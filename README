        ##############
 
 Create 2d visual representation of arbitrary binary files using Hilbert space filling curves 
 to ensure 2d spatial closeness in both x and y directions correlates with linear spatial closeness 
 in target binary file.
 
 The largest possible Hilbert curve is chosen - this is given as percentage coverage of input binary.
 
 Max resultant image size is 1024 * 1024 - if input data is too large it is appropriately decimated.

        ### Compliation and running ###
        ###############################

 Debian based: sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev
 Redhat based: sudo yum install libpng-devel

 cd ./BinVis
 make
 ./bin_vis target_binary [ destination_image.png ]
 
 The program will attempt to automatically display the newly created png image using "feh", which is 
 a commandline image viewer (needs x or x over ssh). If this isn't possible the png is still produced
 and the program will still successfully complete.
 
 Debian based: sudo apt-get install feh
 Redhat based: sudo yum install feh

        ### Colour coding ###
        #####################

 Data processed byte-by-byte. 0x00 coloured as black, 0xFF as while, 0x01 - 0xFE coloured as blue,
 green and then red of increasing intensity.
