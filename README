 Create 2d visual representation of arbitrary binary files using Hilbert space filling curves 
 to ensure 2d spatial closeness in both x and y directions correlates with linear spatial closeness 
 in target binary file.
 
 Largest possible Hilbert curve is choosen - this is given as percentage coverage of input binary.
